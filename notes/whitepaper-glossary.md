**Cybernetic economy**: An economy that integrates legal, governance and operational needs with a unique set of onchain protocols and offchain legal arrangements, purpose-built to balance agile, effective governance structures with trust-minimization and legal compliance, in which the physical and digital worlds merge on top of the “value substrate” of blockchains.
