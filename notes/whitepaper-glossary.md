### Glossary of Interesting Terms from the MetaLeX Whitepaper

_Feel free to propose specific definitions. For now, I've just catalogued some of the more fun/interesting terms that jumped out at me._

- _Cybernetic economy_: An economy that integrates legal, governance and operational needs with a unique set of onchain protocols and offchain legal arrangements, purpose-built to balance agile, effective governance structures with trust-minimization and legal compliance, in which the physical and digital worlds merge on top of the “value substrate” of blockchains.

- _Cybernetic law_: Autonomous systems that integrate a legal structure in the system's event loop.

- _bizBORG_: An independent entity that uses autonomous technologies in its operations.

- _BORG_: A traditional entity (_e.g._, corporations, limited liability companies, foundations, _etc._) that legally mandates the use of autonomous technologies (such as smart contracts and AI) to conduct some or all of its operations and/or governance. Shorthand for a "cyBernetic ORGanization".

_ _BORG CORE_: A standardized guardian contract that enhances a {SAFE} multisig smart account with additional features and protections that support the BORG's operations and governance.

- _DAO-Adjacent BORG_: A BORG entity funded by and undertaking activities beneficial to a parent or sibling DAO, under a carefully constructed set of checks and balances.
