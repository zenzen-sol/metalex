- BORGs are traditional entities (corporations, limited liability companies, foundations, etc.) that legally mandate the use of autonomous technologies (such as smart contracts and AI) to conduct some or all of their operations and/or governance.

- Hybrid code/law solutions should be guided by the following design principles:

  - Maximize the role of trust-minimized smart contracts and other autonomous or decentralized technologies to handle as many deterministic functions as possible.

  - Minimize the role of human discretion and interpretation in the execution of smart contracts and other autonomous or decentralized technologies.

  - Identify edge-cases that may lead to unacceptably unfair, unjust, or unanticipated results and use extrinsic legal mechanisms to ensure that autonomous code is not outcome-determinative in these particular circumstances.

  - Use the existing tools of extrinsic legal regimes to hold accountable trusted human actors who are empowered to halt or influence the outcomes of autonomous technologies.

- In general a BORG should rely on strict code deference, with only narrowly-defined exceptions. 

  - A general preference for code deference can be expressed and made binding via articles of incorporation of a legal entity.
  
  - Strict code deference can result in unintended, negative consequences. 
  
    - Code can become broken or unworkable as a result of externalities that are difficult or impossible to anticipate. Changes to the underlying infrastructure or compute layer may cause application code to halt, or give intended results.
    
  - Where unintended consequences are likely, the BORG should rely on human intervention to resolve disputes and to ensure that the outcomes of autonomous technologies are fair and just.

    - The BORG should first revert to intervention by trusted human delegates.
    
    - If the trusted human delegates fail in their duties, the extrinsic legal systems governing those actors should control, as needed.

  - The rules for selection, qualification, and conduct of human delegates cannot adequately be expressed as executable code.
  
    - For example, the requirement that a human delegate adhere to confidentiality obligations is not something that can be enforced by code alone. 
  
    - Laws and regulations that govern fiduciaries, directors/officers, accredited investor rules, and similar requirements from the extrinsic legal regime should be imported via the formation documents of the BORG's legal entity.

- Phase 1 of MetaLeXâ€™s mission is to create a BORG protocol that can be used by anyone for governance and operaiton of any entity.

  - Legal doc templates and the entities that can be formed with them.

  - Smart contracts that match these legal docs and entities, on the one hand, and any adjacent protocols (including DAOs and their DeFi protocols), on the other hand.

  - A user-friendly interface bringing all BORG and DAO participants together to easily monitor and interact with the BORG.

- Phase 1A is to focus on DAO-adjacent BORGs.

  - For multisig participants, BORGs bring limited liability, clarity of purpose, the ability to easily act in the real-world (create bank accounts etc.) and in some cases other protections, such as contingent anonymity.

  - For DAOs, BORGs bring improved regulatory outcomes (as the DAO itself no longer needs to engage in business-like activities that are subject to regulations, and can instead locate these in BORGs which are able to comply with such regulations) and improved transparency and accountability of multisig members and other project contributors.
